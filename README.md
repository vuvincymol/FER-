This project uses deep learning to recognize emotions from facial images. It’s built using the FER2013 dataset, which has thousands of 48×48 grayscale face pictures. Each picture is labeled with one of seven emotions: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, or Neutral.
We train a model—like a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)—to learn patterns from these images and predict the emotion shown on a person’s face. The final goal is to use this model for real-time emotion detection, like analyzing webcam images live.
